### Reproducible Jupyter Notebook Template

This project is a template to create reproducible notebooks and publications. It also makes use of modern tools and possible best practices known at this time.
It makes use of following python libraries
1. UV : Package Manager (UV is a lightning-fast package manager written in Rust. 
 It offers significant performance improvements over traditional tools like pip and pipenv)
2. Ruff : Python Linter (Ruff is a powerful linter that identifies and corrects common Python code style and quality issues.
 It's designed to be highly efficient and customizable.)
3. Groq AI : A sample notebook demonstrating the usage of Groq AI. a prior account is needed before running this notebook to provide the API key.
4. Myst Markdown for publication.
5. Empty files for CITATION and codemeta.json, to be filled in by the user as part of the exercise.

## Getting Started
1. Create a groq account and keep the API keys handy for the exercies. Refer to for more details : https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Make a copy of this repository by forking it.
3. In the forked repository, run the codespace
