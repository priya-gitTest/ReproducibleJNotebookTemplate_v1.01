### Reproducible Jupyter Notebook Template

**What** : 
 - This project is a template to create reproducible notebooks and publications for your research projects mostly related to data analysis or ML.
 - It makes use of modern tools and possible best practices known at this time. E.g. GitHub codespaces for replication and reproducibility. GitHub Codespaces is a cloud based development enviroment with builin VS Code Support.
 - Acessible from wherever GitHib Website with Internet is accessible to you.
 - Hassle free way to develop your simple codes .

**Why** : You can use this setup for builing your proof of concept very fast and efficiently.

**Pre-requiste** : Knowledge of GIT and Basic Python programming is essential to take this course. 



It makes use of following python libraries :
1. **UV** : Package Manager (UV is a lightning-fast package manager written in Rust. 
 It offers significant performance improvements over traditional tools like pip and pipenv)
2. **Ruff** : Python Linter (Ruff is a powerful linter that identifies and corrects common Python code style and quality issues.
 It's designed to be highly efficient and customizable.)
3. **Groq AI API** : A sample notebook demonstrating the usage of Groq AI. a prior account is needed before running this notebook to provide the API key.
4. **Myst Markdown** for publication.
5. Empty files for CITATION and codemeta.json, to be filled in by the user as part of the exercise.

## Getting Started
1. Create a groq account and keep the API keys handy for the exercies. Refer to for more details : https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Make a copy of this repository by forking it.
3. In the forked repository, run the codespace
